For my Kotlin-based weather app built in Android Studio, I implemented a real-time weather data retrieval system using a backend connected to a third-party weather API. This system allows users to select any country and city to access live weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind conditions. The backend programming includes robust API integration to ensure seamless data flow and updates. Next, I will be enhancing the app's frontend for a user-friendly experience, featuring intuitive navigation for country and city selection. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a local database that stores cities worldwide to optimize search performance and minimize API calls. This project showcases my knowledge of API handling, data management, and responsive UI design in Android development.
